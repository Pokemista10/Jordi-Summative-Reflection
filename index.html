        This was the first year for me doing Computer Science and Design Technology because in the previous school I didn't do these technology subjects.
        At first I wasn't really confident for the reason I wrote before, I a lot <b>confident</b> on <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> because I watched some videos on YouTube to be better.
        My favourite phase of the year was when we learned the secrets of <b>CSS</b> and <b>Marquee</b> or now where we are learning how to build a game in <b>JavaScript</b> to do not confuse with Java, that is a different programming language, because with these you can build an interactive website.
        For me the easiest phase of the Unit was when we learned how to use <b>HTML</b> because <b>it</b> is the easiest language. The hardest phase of the Unit is the actual so the one about <b>JavaScript</b> because it is a a little bit difficult language to learn.
        The main difference between <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> is that HTML is used to build website, CSS is used to modify the text in the website and JavaScript (my favourite) is used to create videogame/to personalize the website, like with JavaScript you can ask the user what colors he wants the backround.
        My favourite language is JavaScript because you can use it to create videogame and to personalize the website (the backround, the font, the font ex.).
        After JavaScript I would like to learn Python because it is a language that I heard from some videos on YouTube. The next year I wish to learn Python and CSharp because it is a languge that I heard on Unity (an app to use to create video games).
